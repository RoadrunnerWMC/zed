Here is all I can say about ZCB Files (Zelda Collision):

Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks ZCB are differents.
I already tried to import a map from ST into PH, model and textures worked great in-game but I fell through the floor. So I used the ZCB generator and same result meaning Gericom ZCB generator is only for ST.

While a ZCB file is in a Hex Editor,
0x0C mean the numbers of differents sections (04 for Phantom Hourglass, 05 for Spirit Tracks)

List of sections:
-BXTV
-BLCP
-BMRN (Spirit Tracks only)
-BIRT
-BDRG

Another weird thing in Phantom Hourglass ZCB
The BDRG section of every maps don't have the right size.

Example:
If I open dngn_flame_00.zcb (Fire Temple first floor) in a Hex Editor, I can see the total file size at 0x08 is DC5A. When I check with CTRL+A file size is only 6970.
BDRG section is wrong, it say 57EC instead of 2280.
