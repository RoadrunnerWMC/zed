# zed

An unfinished library and toolset by me, for viewing and editing files from _The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass_ and _The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks_. Everything here is from late 2017 and early 2018, as you can see from the commit history. (The 2021 commits are just me adding files I didn't commit at the time.)

This repo is archived because I have no plans to finish or otherwise maintain this project. I'm posting it "as-is" because it could be useful to people, even if only as documentation.

**Important note:** the PNGs in the "script_graphs" folder are _huge_ (some larger than 10000x10000) and can easily crash your browser or other applications. They're very cool, but be cautious when opening them due to their size.
